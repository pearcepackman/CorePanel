# CorePanel Notes
### CorePanel Goals
- Desktop application that shows real-time data of computer components, much like MSI Afterburner or Task Manager
- GUI based
- Created in C++, maybe with Python if data visualization is an issue
- CPU, GPU, RAM, other system info, whatever I can get that makes sense
- Data visualization would be nice, graphs, history, tracker, etc.

### Program Goals
- CPU Usage, Temperature
- GPU Usage, Temperature
- RAM Usage, Temperature? (Not sure if RAM has temp sensors?)
- Disk Usage
- GUI, organized, clean, modern, dark maybe?
- Live data
- Graphing
- Logging/Exporting to csv?
- Fan speeds
- Settings would be cool
- Alerts? Like temps/usage?

### Tech Stack
